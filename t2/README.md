# CSS-Excercise-2

skills in this practice:
1. flex: justify-content, align-items
2. line-height: use to vertically center text in a block
3. position absolute&relative + transform:translate(-50%) : use to center block in a container
4. float: when there's need to put an element on the most right place
5. consider about mobile size and use min-width to avoid too much compression (will use RWD in the next excercise)
